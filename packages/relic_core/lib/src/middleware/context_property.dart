/// Manages a piece of data associated with a specific [Request].
///
/// `ContextProperty` allows middleware or other parts of the request handling
/// pipeline to store and retrieve data scoped to a single request. Each
/// property owns one slot in a list the [Request] carries, so a value set on
/// a request is read from that request and the copies made from it, and
/// never from any other request.
///
/// This is useful for passing information like authenticated user objects,
/// request-specific configurations, or other contextual data through different
/// layers of an application.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// // Define a context property for a user object.
/// final _currentUserProperty = ContextProperty<User>('currentUser');
///
/// // In a middleware, set the user for the current request.
/// void authMiddleware(Request context, User user) {
///   _currentUserProperty[context] = user;
/// }
///
/// // Later, in a handler, retrieve the user.
/// User? getCurrentUser(Request context) {
///   return _currentUserProperty[context];
/// }
///
/// // Maybe create an extension method for convenience.
/// extension on Request {
///   User get currentUser => _currentUserProperty.get(this);
/// }
/// ```
